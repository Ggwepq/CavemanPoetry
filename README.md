## Description💬
Poetry for Neanderthals is a family-friendly party game similar to Taboo® where players earn points by getting their teammates to guess words and phrases. The catch is that they can only use single syllable words to give clues. If they use any words with more than one syllable, the other team gets to bop them with a 2-foot inflatable club.

Note: This version of poetry for neanderthals is used only to practice the game. Memorizing the cards can lead you to winning the game but sacrifices enjoyment.
